I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in the Earth Science and Engineering department at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology [(KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en), Saudi Arabia. I am part of the seismic wave analysis group [(SWAG)](https://swag-kaust.github.io/swag-paper-template/) supervised by [Tariq Alkhalifah](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/tariq-a-alkhalifah). I am also a member of [deepwave](https://deepwave.kaust.edu.sa/) consortium, which focuses on machine (deep) learning applications in geophysics. My research focuses on applying machine learning (artificial intelligence) techniques in full-waveform inversion for salt body models and in processing time-lapse seismic. I received my M.S. degree in Earth Science and Engineering at KAUST in 2018 and my B.S. degree in Geophysics in 2016 at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals [(KFUPM)](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx), Saudi Arabia.
