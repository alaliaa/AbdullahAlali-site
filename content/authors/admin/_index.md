I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in Earth Science and Engineering department at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology , Saudi Arabia[(KAUST)](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en)  I am part of the seismic wave analysis group[(SWAG)](https://swag-kaust.github.io/swag-paper-template/)  supervised by prof. Tariq Alkhalifah. My research focuses on applying deep learning techniques in full-waveform inversion for salt body models, and in processing time-lapse seismic. I received my M.S. degree in Earth Science and Engineering at KAUST in 2018 and B.S. degree in Geophysics in 2016 at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals [(KFUPM)](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx) , Saudi Arabia.
