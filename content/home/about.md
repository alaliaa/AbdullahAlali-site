I am a **Ph.D. candidate** in Earth Science and Engineering department at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), Saudi Arabia.  I am part of the seismic wave analysis group (SWAG)  supervised by prof. Tariq Alkhalifah. My research focuses on applying deep learning techniques in full-waveform inversion for salt body models, and in processing time-lapse seismic. I received my M.S. degree in Earth Science and Engineering at KAUST in 2018 and B.S. degree in Geophysics in 2016 at King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM), Saudi Arabia.
